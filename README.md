# *CS-25-344 Sensor Data Fusion and Algorithm Development*
## *U.S. Department of Defense*
## *Short Project Description*
Seeking algorithms that enable the detection of a broad range of threat targets. Detection performance is often reliant on the ability to discriminate targets amongst varying levels of clutter, obscurants, or decoys. In many cases, a single sensing modality is inadequate for high-confidence detection. The U.S. Army is interested in identifying approaches to fusing data from multiple types of sensors and disparate platforms, for example, a wide field-of-view electro-optic imager with a synthetic aperture radar. The primary targets of interest for this effort include surface and buried landmines, located in natural and urban environments.

Further details and descriptions will be provided when we are able to meet with our sponsor from the DoD.
