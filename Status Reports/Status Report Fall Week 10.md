## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
   - Met with advisor and got guideance on how to move forawrd
   - Found a CNN model to use to clean our data
   - Found the waymo dataset we want to use

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   - We need to pick the architecture we want to use
   - Make an algorithm to combine our data
   - Use our dataset to get results

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   - We have not had contact with the army mentor.
   - None of us have used neural networks
   - These datasets are hard to come by
   - CNN architecture is weird
